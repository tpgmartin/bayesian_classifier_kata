# Bayesian Classifier Kata

This repo contains code to create a basic Bayesian classifier. I am following the python example from [this speaker](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10131-fullstack-quants#video).

## Naive Bayes Classifier from Scratch

Code sample originally comes from [this article](https://chrisalbon.com/machine-learning/naive_bayes_classifier_from_scratch.html)

### Python

Run code sample `python nbc.py`, requires numpy and pandas

### Scala

To run scala example, make sure to have [sbt](https://www.scala-lang.org/documentation/getting-started-sbt-track/getting-started-with-scala-and-sbt-in-the-command-line.html) build tools installed. In `/gaussian_naive_bayes/scala` directory run code sample with `sbt run`
